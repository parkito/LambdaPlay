# My unsuccessful experience with using play framework

I tried to use play framework. So, i hate it. Maybe i'm not ready to use such great technology, but i give up.

First of all i don't like sbt. It's slower than even gradle. I used maven, but play and maven aren't good firend.
I spent a lot of time to integrate maven, idea and play. In the end i can build project, but idea can't recognize source files out of box.
I should set up source and test derectories each time i open project.

Mix of html-like files and java code isn't pritty.

Crud repository seems monstrous.

I'll try to continue with exploring this framework, but right now i hate it.
